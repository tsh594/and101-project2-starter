## Summary

**Debugged App** is an android app that was riddled with some pretty nasty Kotlin bugs.  With those gone, it's a collection of widgets for a variety of purposes!  **A multi-activity app demonstrating core Kotlin debugging skills with functional UI components.**

## Notes

Here's a place for any other notes on the app, it's creation process, or what you learned this unit!

**Debugging Kotlin null safety issues was particularly challenging. Learned how to properly handle nullable types with !! and ? operators. The Random Color activity required fixing resource ID mismatches in the color array.**
